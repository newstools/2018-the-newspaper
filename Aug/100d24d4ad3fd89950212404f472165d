It’s time to pop up your parasol and head out to Gabriëlskloof for a celebration of all things new, pretty, fresh and fabulous when this family-owned hilltop winery bids winter farewell with their Little Spring Market on 1 – 2 September 2018. “Spring is the season of rebirth and rejuvenation, and it’s a time we love welcoming back to the hills and valleys that surround our beautiful estate,” says Nicolene Finlayson, tasting room manager and wife of Gabriëlskloof cellarmaster Peter-Allan Finlayson. “It is this very energy we hope to capture and share with our friends through this new, vibrant occasion.” The Little Spring Market invites you to emerge from hibernation and clean out your pantry, stocking it up with wonderful new surprises in store at Gabriëlskloof.
The principle intention of our Little Spring Market is to celebrate spring and all things new and fresh – “In fact, anything to do with happy, rose-tinted days,” says Nicolene.
Visitors will be able to browse an eclectic field from plants to crafts and toys to jewellery with every offering themed to the season’s joyful vibrancy. Live music and a great, spring-inspired food will naturally feature alongside Gabriëlskloof’s diverse and excellent wine collection. “In addition to its focus on spring, Gabriëlskloof’s Little Spring Market is intended to be a relaxing get-away, so we’ve limited the number of stalls. It’s also the perfect warm up for our popular festive season market in December,” Nicolene says. The market coincides with the Bot River Spring Weekend (1 – 2 September) and kicks off Gabriëlskloof’s trio of season-inspired markets.
