Shimmy Beach Club presents the 7th edition of Goldfish Submerged, Cape Town’s biggest summer residency. Following their sold-out international tour of Europe and the States, the hitmakers will resurface in Cape Town starting on Sunday, 9 December for the first of 6 shows, supported by a host of South Africa’s finest DJs and performing artists for the perfect celebration of summer. The electronic duo, David Poole and Dominic Peters, famed for No one has to know and Talk to Me, are classically trained jazz musicians re-inventing the DJ through an infusion of live instruments and vocals, delivering dynamite live performance, with a fusion of house beats and jazz instrumental interludes, earning them their swelling international house and electronic music fan bases. Goldfish have scoured the globe for unique and cheeky samples which they twisted into endlessly fun hooks and choruses. Stirring African rhythms and melodies into the mix helped Goldfish evolve a uniquely South African house sound. Their burnished grooves and a consistent string of chart-topping hits has positioned Goldfish as one of the most influential live electronic groups in dance music.
With festival-style food, world-class production and Shimmy Beach Club’s unsurpassed views of the ocean and Table Mountain, Submerged offers more than just a perfectly curated entertainment line-up this summer. Goldfish Submerged will set sail on Sunday, 9 December and will run on 16, 23, 26 and 29 December with the grand finale on Friday, 4 January 2019.
