Locals can head up Table Mountain for half price this summer with the Cableway’s Sunset Special, valid from 6pm daily until 28 February 2019, excluding 20 December 2018 to 2 January 2019. To experience spectacular African sunsets atop one of the world’s New 7 Wonders of Nature, purchase a return ticket at R145 for adults and R72.50 for children under 18 years of age. It’s the perfect opportunity to take advantage of the season’s long balmy evenings, and don’t forget your camera so that you can capture your #SunsetSpecial moments! Ticketing – Tickets can be purchased online from tablemountain.net or from the Lower Station Ticket Office at any time, but are only valid from 6 pm daily. Have your ID ready – When purchasing Sunset Special tickets online you’ll need to enter your SA ID number and the SA ID numbers of the people who you are buying tickets for. The same rule applies at the Ticket Office. Note: Children under 18 years of age do not require an ID or ID number. A note on parking – Please note that it is not advisable to use the free park-and-ride MyCiTi bus service for the Sunset Special as the service runs until 7pm only. Uber in or park along Tafelberg Road. Dress code – There is none! That said an extra layer never hurt – it can get chilly on top of the mountain after sunset or if the weather starts to change, which it can quickly.
The Cableway operates weather dependant. For more information contact 021 424 8181 or visit www.tablemountain.net Read More Articles
