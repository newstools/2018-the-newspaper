Spier presents its first Light Art Show from 8 December 2018 – 30 January 2019. Each night during this period, visitors will be able to experience a dazzling array of light and sound artworks throughout the historic Stellenbosch farm. Join the opening ceremony on Saturday, 8 December or Sunday, 9 December. Choreographed by Jay Pather, sound and light sculptures will be revealed as the audience follows the procession of performers across a multi-sensory, cross-cultural wonderland. Arrive early, and enjoy a light dinner before the procession starts: Pre-book a ready-made picnic hamper, ready for collection between 17.00 – 19.00 from the Spier Farm Kitchen; you can also create your own picnic from a selection of cold cuts, cheeses, salads, breads, pâté and dips from the Spier Farm Kitchen. Settle in for a farm-to-table feast at Eight Restaurant, alternatively, Vadas Smokehouse & Bakery will be serving up ‘low and slow-smoked’ meats.
