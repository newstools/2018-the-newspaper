With a sunny Christmas around the corner, Benguela Cove Lagoon Wine Estate has just added more sparkle to their wine tourism destination package. Inspired by the brilliant facets of a round diamond, they will uncork the festivities with the launch of their new MCC sparkling wine, Cuvee58. Apart from being great filler for those Christmas stockings, they have also crafted special ruby chocolates to echo the sparkling wine’s character. “Ruby is the most uncommon chocolate discovery in 80 years and will bedazzle you with a complete new chocolate taste. Its natural ruby colour, with no added colour or preservatives, is complemented with an intense fruitiness and fresh sour notes to perfectly match our sparkling wine. Off course, with our own twist on the filling.” The cool Walker Bay is renowned for sauvignon blanc, which became an obvious choice to create a new MCC that is different from their more serious MCC called Joie De Vivre. The Cuvee58 is made to be enjoyed chilled on a hot summer day, served with al fresco dishes.
With growing interest from young couples wanting to tie the knot at Benguela Cove, cellar master Johann Fourie also wanted to create a wine that would add a bright and celebratory feel to any special occasion. Get your tickets for the sparkling event of the year! Join in for a bottomless bubbly afternoon when they raise the first glass of Cuvee58 to their beautiful “la bella” surrounds. Come and indulge in one of the quintessential sunsets over the Bot River Lagoon and the Atlantic Ocean. When: Saturday, 8 December 2018; Where: Benguela Cove Lagoon Wine Estate; Time: 4 – 8pm; Tickets: R320 pp. Bottomless bubbly and plateless pizza will be served between 4 and 6pm only.
