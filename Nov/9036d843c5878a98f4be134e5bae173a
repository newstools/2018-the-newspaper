Onderkloof Wine Estate, situated on the slopes of Schaapenberg on Sir Lowry’s Pass Road in Somerset West, recently celebrated Oktoberfest with bratwurst, pretzels, locally-produced beer and their award winning wine. Onderkloof’s Tasting Room, now open every first Saturday of the month from 11h00 until 15h00, was bustling with visitors and wine bloggers. Not missing the opportunity, many a wine enthusiast captured a memory of the day by taking pictures of the majestic view across False Bay. All the while enjoying Onderkloof’s quality wines and good company.
Some visitors even took to the rolling lawns and started dancing to the tunes of the live band! Handsome winemaker Yves Musfeld entertained guests with tales of Onderkloof’s colourful history since the days of its first owner, Cape Colony governor Willem Adriaan van der Stel.
Beautiful weather, music, fantastic food and excellent wine made this event a fabulously fun afternoon. Don’t miss Onderkloof’s next event – they will be hosting PETS for Walkie & Wine on 3 November.
