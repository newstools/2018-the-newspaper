The Muddy Princess is an outdoor 5km obstacle mud run for women only, and takes place on 1 December 2018 at Sandringham Farm in Stellenbosch. The emphasis of the event is having a “girls’ dirty day out” in the mud. Women with all kinds of fitness levels are welcome, as long as you can crawl, walk, run, climb, laugh and play. There is no competition and no timing – it’s all about lots of fun and laughter.
You can enter in a team or as a single person. Thousands of girls, women, daughters, mothers and besties support each other on the muddy course and on the day all princesses will build a huge team to ensure everybody will make it over the 18-19 obstacles and cross the finish line at their own pace. “Of course we accept failure. We just don’t accept not trying. Join the challenge and we will face all the (muddy) challenges life throws at us together.” For more information visit www.muddyprincess.co.za Read more articles
