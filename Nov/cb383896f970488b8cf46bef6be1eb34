This summer at Idiom you can explore interesting and unusual wines through the prism of macarons, the dainty confection that shares an Italian heritage with the celebrated Helderberg winery which overlooks False Bay. It is not widely known that macarons have been produced in Venetian monasteries since the 8th century AD. Only during the Renaissance period, when Catherine de Medici of Florence married Henry II and became Queen of France, did they become more famous when her personal team of Italian pastry chefs made them for her at the French Royal Court. Likewise, the Bottega Family, owners of Idiom, have a proud Italian heritage. This identity is showcased at their popular Italian Festival held annually at Idiom during the first weekend of March. In addition to producing a number of Idiom wines from Italian grape varieties grown on their property, the family also import and distribute an extensive collection of wines from Italy, which is now on display and for sale downstairs at Idiom in the Vinotria wine library. The macarons are made by the pastry team at Idiom, with ingredients that showcase the character of the wines being paired. The first wine in the pairing line-up is an imported Prosecco called Romeo and Juliet, a bubbly sensation from the Veneto region that has been paired with a chamomile macaron. It is followed by Idiomâ€™s Imperium White Gold, an elegant late harvest viognier served with a lemon macaron. The Idiom Imperium Black Gold Hailstorm is the dramatic conclusion made from Merlot grapes pairs with a beautiful flower-decorated blueberry macaron of dark chocolate ganache, violet jelly, blueberry gel and dried blueberry raisins. The exquisite Idiom Wine & Macaron Experience affords visitors the opportunity to not only sample the wares of true vinous and culinary craft, but also to enjoy spectacular bay views.
