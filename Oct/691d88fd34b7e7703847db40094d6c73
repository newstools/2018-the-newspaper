Be prepared for a total family experience when the Cape Holiday Show returns to the magnificent Sandringham Farm outside Stellenbosch from 26 – 28 October 2018. Building on last year’s inaugural event – and taking heed of what visitors had to say – the Organisors have truly “gone bos” this year to ensure an even wider range of exhibitors to delight outdoor enthusiasts and those who want to explore holiday destinations with a difference. At this stage exhibitors are staking their spots, with many set to use this year’s show to launch new products – and that usually means fabulous specials for those who attend! Great news for visitors to this year’s Cape Outdoor Show in Stellenbosch in October is that 4×4 Mega World will be there in full force with a showcase of accessorised vehicles to inspire and a vast varied range of vehicle accessories and camping gear to make grown men go weak at the knees. For those who want more out of a day in the countryside is the upgrade of the Craft & Cuisine marquee, the addition of a Kiddie Activity Centre, more outdoor activities for grown-ups – and even live music to add to the festivities. The word is that the top 10 Foodtrucks in the country will be there to serve up delights and aside from activities such as clay pigeon shooting. This unique summer show offers an inspiring array of must-haves for the outdoors enthusiast: caravans, camper vans and all the gadgets and gizmos imaginable to elevate old-school camping trips into a luxurious lifestyle choice. Also, on hand are travel specialists to inspire the perfect getaways that showcase the country’s outdoor splendour through unique destinations perfectly suited for those who want white-knuckled adventure to those who are content to simply “Glamp” in style in breath-taking settings.
