Make a difference in the lives of children whilst participating in The Gratitude Run by Distance for Difference (D4D) on Saturday, 20 October 2018 at Lourensford Wine Estate, Somerset West. All funds raised will go towards various children’s charities. Whether you’re a runner or enjoy walking, you have three options to choose from. “The 5km Fun Run/Walk is ideal for young and old as you set your own pace. The 10km Trail Run offers one of the most scenic routes in the Western Cape and will be timed. The last option is a six-hour, 5km Team Relay Run. Runners enter as a team with a minimum of 1 and maximum of six team members and run laps of 5km each. The challenge for teams will be to complete as many 5km laps as possible in the allotted time period, as well as raise a minimum of R5 000,” says Stéphan Pieterse, Chief People Officer at Pragma, and founder of D4D. Distance For Difference (D4D), is a registered non-profit organisation (182-816 NPO) which, over the last thirteen years, made a significant contribution towards the wellbeing of children, be it through children’s charities or individual children in need. “Help us make a significant difference!” Pieterse concludes.
