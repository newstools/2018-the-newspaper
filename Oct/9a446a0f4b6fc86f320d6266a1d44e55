Cape Wine Academy will host interactive wine tastings alongside local winemakers in the #TasteTheLifestyle tent overlooking the river Local winemakers will be conducting wine safaris on nearby farms, taking festival goers through the vineyards to learn more about the terroir and into underground cellars to discover the stories behind the vintages
Other festival activities include a country central market, a dedicated children’s area, a boat cruise on the Viljoensdrift, a helicopter ride, stargazing, open campfires and many more. Glamping weeekend packages is also available.
