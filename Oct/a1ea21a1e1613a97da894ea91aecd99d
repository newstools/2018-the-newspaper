Situated in one of our countries most beautiful areas, visitors can’t get enough of the big variety of little shops and restaurants at Hartenbos Seafront. The centre has a calming atmosphere, perfect for getting into the vacation mode. Moreover, you won’t easily find a place with such a spectacular view. There is something for each family members’ enjoyment. For the youngsters, there is a stunning theme park that looks like something out of a magazine – with everything from waterslides, putt-putt to a massive play-area. In this area there are also sun loungers where you can chill in the sun while keeping an eye on the kids. For the winter days and cold nights, there’s a lovely heated pool. When the women are done walking through the shops, they can be spoiled with a massage or manicure, while hubby sips on an ice cold beer while looking over the ocean at Ocean Basket, Pizza e Vino or Spur. There is a big variety of small eateries with options like pizza-cones, fish and chips, as well as snacks like biltong and mouth-watering Zoooti ice cream. After all that food and relaxation, you can hit the Wellness World gym to feel less guilty about all those delicious calories. “We also have a conference room with a view over the ocean, a great way to stimulate those creative thoughts. Hartenbos Seafront is also the proud home of the SFM 90.1 studio, which can be thanked for hours of musical entertainment, international news, riddles and much more. So come on, bring your family and friends and join in the endless fun to suit everyone’s taste. For the young of age and the young at heart.” For more information visit www.hartenbos-seefront.co.za Read more articles
