MEC Fritz calls on the broader George and Garden Route community to support the victims in this time of need. MEC Fritz said, “I call on all residents to support the victims and firefighters where possible. To ensure that our firefighters remain strong enough to fight this blaze, they require donations of small bottles of water, juice, energy drinks, lip balm, wet wipes, rehydration packets, energy bars and chocolates” Donations towards the firefighting efforts can be delivered to the George Fire Brigade at Mitchell Street, behind Outeniqua Primary sport fields. MEC Fritz further said, “Residents living within the affected areas should keep their windows and doors closed until further notice as protection against smoke and heat; keep pets indoors where possible; move garden furniture that is flammable under cover; wet thatched roofs and ensure gutters are clean.” The Department of Social Development in the Western Cape will continue to provide services and support during this time to all those affected by the fire, ensuring they get back on their feet as quickly as possible.
