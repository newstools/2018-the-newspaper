Come and meet an aerial ‘big five’ when Nemo, Squid, Octopus, Red Teddy and Bertie the Worm take to the skies at the 24th Cape Town International Kite Festival on 27 – 28 October 2018 at the Zandvlei Nature Reserve in Muizenberg. It is Africa’s biggest kite festival and sees kiters from around the world flying incredible kite creations in support of Cape Mental Health, South Africa’s oldest mental health organisation. The annual kiting extravaganza is the grand finale to October’s Mental Health Month campaign and has been flying in support of Cape Mental Health since 1994.
“Rise Up is our theme for 2018,” says Ingrid Daniels, director of Cape Mental Health and president elect of the World Federation for Mental Health. “We believe everyone is born with potential to rise up beyond life’s circumstances. Our mission and the services we provide help people realise this potential and overcome mental health challenges they may encounter. Kites are one of the tools we use. Almost everyone feels inspired when they simply lift their heads and look up.” Statistics show that every year one person in four will have a mental health condition. Mental health affects everyone but for people living in a disadvantaged urban or rural community, the impact of disability and poverty can be particularly challenging. Bring along your own kite to fly in the public flying arena, buy a kite when you are there or make a kite at one of the many free kite-making workshops for children and adults, on both days of the festival. There is also live entertainment, a tea garden, food trucks and fairground rides. The free, supervised Toddler Zone gives parents a chance to sit down and relax.
