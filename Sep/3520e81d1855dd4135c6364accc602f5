Sanlam Cape Town Marathon will welcome a world-class elite-athlete line-up while public interest in the event gains momentum. Entries to Africa’s only IAAF Gold Label-status road race are pouring in as runners from South Africa and around the globe prepare for the springtime event on 23 September 2018 in Cape Town. Last year over 20 000 participants from all over the world ran the various courses, with the marathon itself hosting a field of just over 10 000 entrants, cementing its position among the continent’s most popular road-running events. “International top-flight support for the event grows yearly, and this year we have three Ethiopians, four Kenyans, and one representative each from Australia, the UK, Namibia, Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe running alongside South Africa’s top marathon runners Stephen Mokoka, Desmond Mokgobu, Xolisa Tyali, Lebo Phalula, Nolene Conrad and Lebogang Phalula,” says race ambassador Elana van Zyl-Meyer. No fewer than 50 charities from across South Africa are affiliated with this year’s event, with the programme designed to promote change in health, sustainability, peace and development. Other organizations involved include Endurocad, a distance-running and endurance-sports academy; The Jag Foundation which uses sport as an educational tool to develop life skills in communities affected by gangsterism, drugs and abuse, and the Stellenbosch University who is using the marathon as a major catalyst to drive interest in its #Move4Food initiative. With spectator support being a crucial component in spurring on the runners, organisers of this year’s Sanlam Cape Town Marathon are encouraging the broader public to support the race on the day by simply making their way to any one of the specially created spectator zones which will feature a mix of live entertainment, food and drink, and together bring the “gees” needed to keep the runners going. While the marathon itself is the pinnacle of the festival, on Saturday, 22 September the two Peace Trail Runs (22km and 12km) take place, as well as a 5km PEACE Run/Walk, with the 10km Peace Run on Sunday.
