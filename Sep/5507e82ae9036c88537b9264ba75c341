The Darling Wildflower Society has been around for more than a century and the Society’s Show takes place annually from 14-16 September 2018! It celebrates an integral part of the Cape Fynbos Kingdom comprised of Renosterveld, Rietveld, Sandveld, and Strandveld where more than 1200 different species of flowers can be found. The show will be celebrating 101 years with the theme: Conservation and the next generation. The display will focus on the Wildflower Society’s development through the past 101 years as well as the Herbarium project. The Flower Show will offer a variety of activities to entertain young and old such as: the Landscaped Hall depicting the flowers of the area in their natural habitat, a Craft & Gourmet Food Market, a Veteran Tractor/Car Display, an Entertainment Tent featuring live music from famous local acts as well as a range of workshops. In addition there will be a shuttle driving through Darling, and stopping at places of interest including the Darling Museum, Evita’s Perron, Duckitt Nurseries, Darling Main Road and the Renosterveld Reserve. With more than a hundred food and craft stalls, everyone’s taste buds and shopping needs will be catered for! Kids will have a weekend of fun in the playpark area with entertainment ranging from face-painting to rides, while adults can relax in the Mini Wine Route & Beer Tent.
