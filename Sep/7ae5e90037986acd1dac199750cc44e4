In light of September being World Alzheimer’s Month, CPOA will be hosting its first Alzheimer’s Awareness Seminar which will be taking place at CPOA’s Sea Point Place. Primarily tailored for those who have a loved one who has been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s or another form of dementia, the seminar aims to educate guests about various aspects when it comes to dementia care, thereby promoting better awareness and understanding of the illness. Topics that will be discussed include identifying early warning signs, knowing when to go for diagnosis, when to consider full-time care, the importance of diet, how often one should visit family members, and journeying with a loved one living with dementia. These topics will be discussed by experts within their fields, namely Karen Borochowitz (Executive Director of Dementia SA), Dr Julie Etellin (General Practitioner at The Health Team), Jill Robson (Western Cape Regional Manager of Alzheimer’s South Africa), and Dr Alice Ashwell (Educator & Life Coach at Dementia Connections). For those interested in gaining insight into CPOA’s individualised approach to memory care, guests will also have the opportunity to view Sea Point Place’s recently developed specialised Memory Care Centre through a guided tour. After extensive research into the latest international trends and studies regarding care for Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia, the Memory Care Centre has been designed with the goal of providing a homely environment that stimulates body and mind, promoting an engaging and fulfilling lifestyle for its residents. The seminar will take place on Friday 28 September from 10:00 – 13:00 and registrations close on 14 September 2018. Any registrations or queries can be directed to Chantal Adams or Monique Alcock on 021 686 7830. For more information about CPOA’s Alzheimer’s Awareness Seminar, please visit www.cpoa.co.za/seminar.
