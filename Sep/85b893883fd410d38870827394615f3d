The ultimate dining experience is a seamless integration of many elements – an inspiring setting, the finest seasonal ingredients, service excellence, a talented team and an executive chef with a clear sense of purpose. The internationally acclaimed La Colombe located at the Silvermist Estate in the Constantia Valley recently underwent an extensive renovation, with all these elements being carefully assessed, with the aim of providing customers a pinnacle dining experience. The La Colombe interior has been comprehensively revamped, offering a sense of space and tranquillity that mirrors its environment. La Colombe means ‘the dove’ and you’ll see this bird’s subtle presence throughout. Firstly, in the majestic, hand-drawn artwork by Lucie de Moyencourt on the main feature wall, and then also the carved wooden doves by local artisan Lameck Tayengwa. The white oiled chevron oak floors, travertine mosaic and hand-cut bespoke terracotta tiles, and the touches of brass and oak complement the crisp white linen of fine dining.
Having been closed for six weeks for this major revamp, La Colombe reopened with former Head Chef James Gaag, now full time at the helm as Executive Chef. There’ll be a new menu, keeping true to form to deliver the kind of dishes diners have come to expect of this award-winning establishment. “I’m delighted to finally realise my dream of running La Colombe. My team and I are excited for this new and exciting chapter. We’ll be keeping some signature dishes on the menu, and can’t wait to introduce everyone to the new dishes. First and foremost, is a balance of flavours. I believe food should be delicious and inviting and not overthought, overworked or overcomplicated,” says James.
